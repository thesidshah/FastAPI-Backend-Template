# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Disclose Publicly

Please do not create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. This helps prevent malicious actors from exploiting the vulnerability before a fix is available.

### 2. Report Via Private Channel

Send your vulnerability report to the project maintainers via:
- GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)
- Direct email to the maintainers

### 3. Include Details

Your report should include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information (optional, for follow-up)

### Example Report Format

```
## Vulnerability Type
[e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, Authentication Bypass]

## Affected Component
[e.g., Authentication middleware, User API endpoint]

## Description
[Clear description of the vulnerability]

## Steps to Reproduce
1. [First Step]
2. [Second Step]
3. [Additional Steps...]

## Impact
[What could an attacker do with this vulnerability?]

## Suggested Fix
[If you have suggestions on how to fix it]
```

## Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report
- **Confirmation**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 1-4 weeks
  - Medium: 1-3 months
  - Low: Best effort

## Security Update Process

1. Vulnerability is reported and confirmed
2. Fix is developed and tested
3. Security advisory is drafted
4. Patch is released
5. Security advisory is published
6. Users are notified

## Security Best Practices

When using this template, follow these security best practices:

### 1. Environment Configuration

- Never commit `.env` files
- Use strong, randomly generated secrets in production
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use environment-specific configurations

```bash
# Generate a secure secret
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### 2. JWT Configuration

```bash
# Production JWT secret (example)
SECURITY_JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
SECURITY_JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
SECURITY_JWT_EXPIRY_MINUTES=30
```

### 3. CORS Configuration

Only allow trusted origins:

```bash
# Bad - allows all origins
APP_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=["*"]

# Good - specific origins only
APP_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=["https://yourdomain.com"]
```

### 4. Rate Limiting

Enable and configure rate limiting:

```bash
SECURITY_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
SECURITY_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=60
SECURITY_RATE_LIMIT_PER_HOUR=1000
```

### 5. Security Headers

Enable security headers in production:

```bash
SECURITY_ENABLE_HSTS=true
SECURITY_ENABLE_CSP=true
SECURITY_CSP_POLICY="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'"
```

### 6. Proxy Configuration

If behind a reverse proxy:

```bash
SECURITY_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true
SECURITY_TRUSTED_PROXIES=["10.0.0.1"]
```

### 7. Content Validation

Configure appropriate limits:

```bash
SECURITY_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE=52428800  # 50MB
SECURITY_MAX_REQUEST_SIZE=1048576  # 1MB
SECURITY_BLOCK_NULL_BYTES=true
```

### 8. Dependencies

- Keep dependencies updated
- Regularly run security audits:

```bash
pip install pip-audit
pip-audit
```

### 9. Production Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Changed all default secrets
- [ ] Configured CORS properly
- [ ] Enabled HTTPS
- [ ] Enabled security headers
- [ ] Configured rate limiting
- [ ] Set up logging and monitoring
- [ ] Configured allowed hosts
- [ ] Disabled debug mode
- [ ] Set appropriate environment
- [ ] Reviewed all security settings

### 10. Monitoring

- Enable security alerting
- Monitor authentication failures
- Track rate limit violations
- Set up automated security scanning

## Known Security Considerations

### Authentication

This template includes JWT authentication, but:
- Implement token refresh mechanisms
- Consider token revocation strategies
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper session management

### Rate Limiting

- In-memory rate limiting is per-instance
- Use Redis for distributed rate limiting in production
- Configure appropriate limits for your use case

### Logging

- Don't log sensitive information (passwords, tokens)
- Be careful with request body logging in production
- Implement log aggregation and monitoring

## Disclosure Policy

- We follow responsible disclosure principles
- Security issues are fixed before public disclosure
- Credit is given to researchers who report vulnerabilities
- We maintain a security advisory record
